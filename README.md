# Python ToDo App

This is a small console-based ToDo application built in Python.  

It's my first official Python program, created as a way to practice the basics of the language and get comfortable with Python syntax.

## Features

- Add a new task
- Mark a task as completed
- Delete a task
- Display all tasks

Each task is stored as a list with a name and a status (completed or not).

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to practice Python fundamentals such as:

- Lists
- Functions
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- User input

## How to Use

1. Run the script `todo.py` in a Python environment.
2. Follow the commands displayed in the terminal to manage your tasks.
3. Enjoy experimenting with Python and learning the basics!

This project helped me understand how to structure a simple program and interact with users in the console. It's a great starting point for building more complex Python applications.
